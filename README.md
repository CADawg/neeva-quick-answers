# neeva-quick-answers
DuckDuckGo-style Instant answers for @neevaco (Unofficial)

## Usage

1. Install tampermonkey.
2. Visit https://git.dbuidl.com/Snaddyvitch-Dispenser/neeva-quick-answers/raw/branch/main/neevaquickanswers.user.js to install it (click install when tampermonkey asks)
3. search `sha256 test` as your first query (the first query has to use a page which has no special results at the top due to the way it clones the elements. (Also needs to be done on subsequent updates)

If you load it on a page with special elements first, go into the localStorage in your browser (while on neeva) and delete the `instantAnswerDetail` and `instantAnswerVersion` values.
